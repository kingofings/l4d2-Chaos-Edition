# l4d2-Chaos-Edition
My first ever Left 4 Dead 2 Project inspired by the SM64 Mod Chaos Edition by Kaze Emanuar.

This Plugin basically emulates the gameplay of SM64 Chaos edition.
This mod is basically my training for coding in sourcepawn, some parts of the code if not all of it might not be very good or efficient, keep that in mind!
